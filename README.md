# Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLM)

## Overview

> Generative AI is a subset of AI, where generative models are used to create content such as text, images etc. This project will focus on generating text content.

This project consists of three generative AI models:
1. **Chatbot:**<br/>LLM based chatbots generate contextually relevant responses to the end user's queries while considering the entire interaction between chatbot and end user, and personalising its interaction to meet the end user's goal.  
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot:**<br/>A Framework that uses LLMs and private data to provide the end user with more accurate, up-to-date and contextually relevant answers. This is done through retrieval and generation. Relevant information on the end user's query is found in the private documents and sent to the LLM. The model then generates a response using the end user's query, the private information received and its own internal knowledge.
3. **Summariser:**<br/>With use of LLMs concise or specifically structured summaries are generated from longer text documents. The summaries can be generated using a variety of techniques which are showcased in this project.

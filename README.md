## Overview

> Generative AI is...

This project consists of three generative AI models:
1. A Chatbot:
2. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot:**<br/><br/>A Framework that uses LLMs and private data to provide the end user with more accurate, up-to-date and contextually relevant answers. This is done through retrieval and generation. Relevant information on the end user's query is found in the private documents and sent to the LLM. The model then generates a response using the end user's query, the private information received and its own internal knowledge.
